# General Info

You can try to knit the projects, but some raw data is missing due to size limits. View the already outputted report as the .html file in each project. 

# Restaurant Analysis

Uses data gathered with Python and the Google Maps API to compare different variables to determine if Salt Lake City or San Diego has the better restaurants.

# Utah Weather Data

Statistical analysis to determine the answer to four proposed climate questions:

    - What is the “hottest year” on record in Utah?
    - What is the “coldest year” on record in Utah?
    - Is Utah drier than it was 80 years ago?
    - What is the average low temperature in Salt Lake City in January?
    
# Linux Processes

Gathers several different types of data from a Linux Machine in the Utah computer lab (page faults, packets received, etc) to see if they follow common statistical distributions.  
    
# Final Project

Aims to determine if certain college majors (e.g. computer science, philosophy) use their degree more often. Data was scraped from LinkedIn using Python scripts in the /FinalProject/Python directory.
